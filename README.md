# ML_stuff

Machine Learning models used to train the MNIST data set.

Classifers used: 
1. Random Forrest
2. XG Boost
3. Ada Boost
4. SVM rbf kernel
5. SVM linear
6. Decision Tree

The accuracies, time taken to train/predict, recall, f1score, & precision of the models are calculated and plotted.

Trained models are saved as ``.sav`` file for easy reuse using ``pickle``.

AutoML is used on the dataset well. Results are stored in csv.
